This Python script is designed to simulate a simple billing system for a supermarket. It allows users to input their name, select items from a predefined list along with their quantities, and then generates a bill including item details, quantities, prices, and total amount. This script can be updated on GitHub with a brief description such as "Python script for a supermarket billing system, including item selection, quantity input, and GST calculation."
