This Python script is designed to simulate a simple billing system for a supermarket. It allows users to input their name, select items from a predefined list along with their quantities, and then generates a bill including item details, quantities, prices, and total amount. Additionally, it calculates GST (Goods and Services Tax) based on the total price and displays the final amount including CGST (Central Goods and Services Tax) and SGST (State Goods and Services Tax). Finally, it prints a formatted bill for the user. This script can be updated on GitHub with a brief description such as "Python script for a supermarket billing system, including item selection, quantity input, and GST calculation."
